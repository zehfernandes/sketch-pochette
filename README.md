# Sketch Pochette

## Why this Plugin?

Every time you want to edit your elements precisely, you need to travel with your mouse to the panel inspector. So to avoid this repeated movement, *sketch-pochette* brings the properties close to where your mouse is. Thinking about how Painting artists carry their brushes and colors in a pallet; as digital artists, we need our tools closely too.

Bonus point bumbags are cool again.

## Install

    
1. Download and open **[sketch-pochette-master.zip](https://github.com/zehfernandes/sketch-pochette/releases/download/v0.6.0/sketchpochette.sketchplugin.zip)**.
